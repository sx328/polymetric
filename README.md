# ðŸ“Š Polymetric

Polymetric is an all-in-one community management and analytics platform designed specifically for NFT projects on the Polygon blockchain.

## Why Polygon?

Polymetric focuses on the Polygon EVM Blockchain because of its high performance, low fees, and growing ecosystem of NFT projects. Polygon offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for developers building on the Ethereum network, making it an ideal choice for NFT projects that require fast, reliable transactions and low transaction costs, which we believe will be increasingly important as NFTs become more mainstream.

The Polygon network also has a vibrant and growing community of developers and users, which makes it an attractive platform for building and launching NFT projects. By focusing on Polygon, Polymetric aims to provide a centralized hub for community management and analytics that is tailored to the specific needs of NFT projects on this blockchain. Especially on the cusp of zkEVM, we believe that Polygon will be a major player in the NFT space in the coming years, and we want to help NFT projects on this blockchain thrive. :rocket:
